\section{Introduction}

The \tmtexttt{POWHEG BOX} program is a framework for implementing NLO
calculations in Shower Monte Carlo programs according to the
\POWHEG{} method. An explanation of the method and a discussion of
how the code is organized can be found in
Refs.~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}. The code is
distributed according to the ``MCNET GUIDELINES for Event Generator
Authors and Users'' and can be found at the web page \\

This program is an implementation of the Drell-Yan NLO cross sections
$pp\to W \to \ell \nu$ including QCD and ElectroWeak (EW) 
radiative corrections. 
A detailed description of the implementation can be found in 
Ref.~\cite{Barze:2012tt}. 
%Please cite the paper when you use the program. \\
In order to run the \tmtexttt{POWHEG BOX} program, we recommend the
reader to start from the \tmtexttt{POWHEG BOX} user manual, which
contains all the information and settings that are common between
all subprocesses. In this note we focus on  the settings and
parameters specific to the $W$ implementation.

\section{Generation of events}

Build the executable\\
\tmtexttt{\$ cd POWHEG-BOX-V2/W\_ew-BMNNP \\
\$ make pwhg\_main }\\
Then do (for example) \\
\tmtexttt{\$
cd runtest-lhc-8TeV\\
\$ ../pwhg\_main}\\
At
the end of the run, the file \tmtexttt{pwgevents.lhe} will contain
100000 events for $W^+ \to e^+ \nu_e$  in the Les Houches format. 
In order to shower them with \PYTHIASIX{} do\\~\\
\tmtexttt{\$
cd POWHEG-BOX-V2/W\_ew-BMNNP \\ \$ make
main-PYTHIA-lhef \\ \$ cd
runtest-lhc-8TeV \\
\$ ../main-PYTHIA-lhef}
\\
\\
If you prefer to shower the event with \PYTHIAEIGHT{} do\\~\\
\tmtexttt{\$
cd POWHEG-BOX-V2/W\_ew-BMNNP \\ \$ make
main-PYTHIA8-lhef \\ \$ cd
runtest-lhc-8TeV \\
\$ ../main-PYTHIA-lhef}


\section{Process specific input parameters}

Mandatory parameters are those needed to select the final state
leptonic species coming from the vector-boson:
~\\
\tmtexttt{
  idvecbos 24 \phantom{a} ! PDG code for vector boson to be produced\\
  \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaa} ! ( W+: 24 W-: -24 )\\
  vdecaymode 11 !  code for selected W decay\\
  \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaa} ! (11(-11): electronic; 13(-13): muonic; 15(-15): tauonic)}
\\
Together with the mandatory parameters, the \POWHEGBOX{} input facility 
allows for an easy 
setting of EW and run parameters, by explicitly adding the relevant 
lines to the input card. 
If one of the following entries is not present in the input card  the reported default 
value is assumed. In any case, these parameters are printed in the output of the program, so their values can be easily tracked down. 
~\\~\\
 \tmtexttt{
   Wmass\phantom{aa}  80.398 \phantom{aaaaaaa} ! W mass in GeV\\
   Wwidth\phantom{a} 2.141 \phantom{aaaaaaaa} ! W width in GeV\\
   Zmass\phantom{aa}  91.1876 \phantom{aaaaaa}   ! Z mass in GeV\\
   Zwidth\phantom{a} 2.4952 \phantom{aaaaaaa} ! Z width in GeV\\

   Smass\phantom{aa} 0.15 \phantom{aaaaaaaaa} ! S quark mass in GeV\\
   Umass\phantom{aa} 0.06983 \phantom{aaaaaa} ! U quark mass in GeV\\
   Dmass\phantom{aa} 0.06984 \phantom{aaaaaa} ! D quark mass in GeV\\
   Elmass\phantom{a} 0.005109989 \phantom{aa} ! Electron mass in GeV\\
   Mumass\phantom{a} 0.105658369 \phantom{aa} ! Mu mass in GeV\\
   Taumass\phantom{} 1.77699 \phantom{aaaaaa} ! Tau mass in GeV\\
}
\\
The following parameter limits from below the virtuality of the $W$ boson:
\\
\tmtexttt{mass\_low 1 \phantom{aaaaaaaa}! W virtuality > mass\_low in GeV}\\
\\
If absent, it is set to 1~GeV. 
In order to avoid edge effects, the lower limit \tmtexttt{mass\_low} 
should be more inclusive w.r.t. cuts applied at the analysis level.
Notice that, if photons are generated, the $W$ virtuality is not
necessarily the mass of the charged lepton neutrino system.

\\
\\
The EW radiative corrections can be calculated according to two 
different schemes: the $\alpha(0)$ scheme, where the input parameters 
are $\alpha(0)$, $M_W$ and $M_Z$; the $G_\mu$ scheme, where the 
input parameters are $G_\mu$, $M_W$ and $M_Z$. The latter one 
(default in the code) is preferred because it minimizes 
the EW corrections and the uncertainties due to the light quark masses. 
\\
The EW corrections can be switched off by setting
\\
\tmtexttt{no\_ew 1       ! default 0}
\\
and the strong corrections can be switched off by setting
\\
\tmtexttt{no\_strong 1       ! default 0}
\\
This last option is just to check EW corrections at the NLO level (i.e.,
the Les Houches events do not have much meaning).
\\
\\
The program can be interfaced to both \PYTHIASIX{} and  \PYTHIAEIGHT{},
by doing
\\
\tmtexttt{make main-PYTHIA-lhef}
\\
for \PYTHIASIX{} and
\\
\tmtexttt{make main-PYTHIA8-lhef}.
\\
for \PYTHIAEIGHT{}.
\\
In the case of \PYTHIASIX{} one can also optionally switch off photon radiation
from  \PYTHIASIX{} and use \PHOTOS{}~\cite{Golonka:2005pn}
instead. This is done by setting:
\\
\tmtexttt{use\_photos 1   ! default 0}
\\
in the \tmtexttt{powheg.input} file.
\\
The \PHOTOS \, source code is included in the \POWHEGBOX. 
\\
\\
For photon final state radiation a comment is in order. According to 
the \POWHEG{} method, the radiation by the shower has to be generated 
from a starting scale given by the hardest $\pt$ tried at the matrix element 
level (the variable {\tt scalup} written in the event file 
\tmtexttt{pwgevents.lhe}). This is true also in the case that both 
QCD and QED radiation are present, as detailed in 
Ref.~\cite{Barze:2012tt} . Both \PYTHIASIX{} and \PYTHIAEIGHT{} 
do not use this starting scale for the generation of QED final state radiation 
from the $W$. Hence, in order to avoid double counting of QED radiation, 
a veto algorithm is necessary. The same problem is present also using 
\PHOTOS{}. 
This algorithm 
is provided automatically in the files \tmtexttt{main-PYTHIA-lhef.f} and 
\tmtexttt{scalupveto.f}. The same algorithm is implemented for 
\PYTHIAEIGHT{}. In this case, however, the user can optionally 
adopt the internal algorithm of \PYTHIAEIGHT, which is switched 
on by setting:
\\
\tmtexttt{py8veto 1   ! default 0}
\\
in the \tmtexttt{powheg.input} file.
\\
\\
A general issue is the matching between the NLO calculation and the 
(QCD and QED) higher order corrections given by the parton shower: 
due to the different definitions of $p_\perp$ in \POWHEG{} and 
\PYTHIAEIGHT{}/\PYTHIASIX{}, some double counting or dead zone 
can arise. In \PYTHIAEIGHT{} the default is to generate all QCD/QED 
shower emissions up to the kinematical limit and then veto emissions 
harder than the \POWHEG{} emission, according to the \POWHEG{} 
$p_\perp$ definition. This is done, as default, by means of the provided 
\tmtexttt{class PowhegHooks}. With the provided \PYTHIAEIGHT{} interface 
the user can optionally choose an alternative scheme, where 
the shower starting scale is fixed to {\tt scalup} and no veto 
is performed. This choice can be activated by setting 
\\
\tmtexttt{veto1 1   ! default 0}
\\
in the \tmtexttt{powheg.input} file.
\\
\\
In this case, if the QED higher order radiation is handled by \PYTHIAEIGHT{}, 
also the QED starting scale is set to {\tt scalup} through the 
\tmtexttt{class MyUserHooks}. 
\\ 
\\
\\
Additional flags available for the \PYTHIAEIGHT{} interface 
are the following (they can be set in the \tmtexttt{powheg.input} file): 
\\
\tmtexttt{noQEDq 1   ! default 0}, which allows to switch off QED radiation 
from quarks; 
\\
\tmtexttt{pytune xx  ! default 5}, which allows to change the tune; 
\\
\tmtexttt{nohad 1  ! default 0}, which allows to swith off the hadronization. 
\\
\\
\\
As a last comment, in the provided interface to \PYTHIAEIGHT{} 
the decay of hadronic resonances which can proceed radiatively has been 
suppressed. In order to let the resonances decay, the user should 
open the file \tmtexttt{pythia8F77.cc} and comment the relevant lines 
in {\tt pythia\_init}.



\section{Generation of a sample with $W^+$ and $W^-$
  events}\label{sec:merging}

In case the user is interested in the generation of a sample where
both $W^+$ and $W^-$ events appear, a script and a dedicated
executable have been included. The script is named
\tmtexttt{merge\_wp\_wm.sh} and can be found in the directory
\tmtexttt{W/testrun-merge}. It can be run in any subfolder of
\tmtexttt{W} however. Three inputs are mandatory: the first two are
the prefixes of the input files used to generate $W^+$ and $W^-$
events. The third input has to be an integer and correspond to the
total number of events that the final \emph{merged} sample will
contain. The script has to be run twice, using a positive integer
value at the first call and its opposite afterwards.  Therefore, for
example, to produce a sample of 10000 events, starting from the input
files \tmtexttt{wp-powheg.input} and \tmtexttt{wm-powheg.input}, the
invocation lines should be as follows:~\\~\\ \tmtexttt{\$ sh
  merge\_wp\_wm.sh wp wm 10000}\\~\\ and then~\\~\\ \tmtexttt{\$ sh
  merge\_wp\_wm.sh wp wm -10000}\\~\\

Few remarks are needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is responsability of the user to check that the 2 input files
  are equal. The \tmtexttt{idvecbos}  and \tmtexttt{vdecaymode} tokens have to be different,
  obviously.
\item the two values of \tmtexttt{numevts} are not really used: the
  program re-calculate the needed values as a function of the $W^+$ and
  $W^-$ cross sections and of the total number of events to be
  generated.
\item the final event file is always named
  \tmtexttt{wp\_wm\_sample-events.lhe}. In the header section it also
  contains a copy of the two input files used to generate it, for
  cross-checking purposes
\end{itemize}
