The generation must be done with vdecaymode=+-15

gen_emutau <= 1 :: standard behaviour (DEFAULT)
gen_emutau == 2 :: the events are generated with vdecaymode = +-15
                   the xsect /err is multiplied by 2 in lhefwrite
		   the weights are multiplied by 2 in lhefwrite
		   the flavours are assigned randomly (e/mu) in
		   LesHouches AND LesHouchesreg
gen_emutau == 3 :: the events are generated with vdecaymode = +-15
                   the xsect /err is multiplied by 3 in lhefwrite
		   the weights are multiplied by 3 in lhefwrite
		   the flavours are assigned randomly (e/mu/tau) in
		   LesHouches AND LesHouchesreg		   

NB this way the pwgalone results are NOT reliable: one has to run lhef_analysis instead

After the event generation (lhef_analysis and main-pythia):

we cannot define vdecaymode as a constant from lprup

1) in lhefreadheader reloads the gen_emutau option
2) in lhefreadev save the true id of the lepton (common/clepid/)
3) in the phytia/photos related files lprup -> lepid (and then computes vdecaytemp)
4) the old analysis will still use lprup, and they will trow an error if gen_emutau>1
5) a new "atlas" analysis is provided for gen_emutau>1

PS in order to use pwhg_analysis-atlas-leptons.f without NaNs in st1-st4
   we define lepid in analysis_driver (this routine is never called after st4,
   so there is no conflict with the value in lhefreadev)

TODO :: vdecaytemp (lprup) is used in analyses and pythia interface (e.g. vetoes)
        MUST BE REPLACED BY THE ACTUAL LEPTON FLAVOUR (USE A COMMON VARIABLE)
	FOR THE ANALYSES one has to specify the strategy (ASK!!)


MEANWHILE ADDED PY82
1) minimal modifications of pythia8f77 to have it compiling
2) added random seed initialization in both py81 and py82
3) added corresponding lines in Makefile


MEANWHILE for fastjet 3
1) added missing safe initialization in buildjets.f
