In order to perform a parallel run, modify the runpar.sh script to
suite your system, and execute it.

NOTICE:

the total number of ncall1 times the number of processes (24 in
the example) should roughly match the value of ncall1 in the test/powheg.input
file;

the number ncall2 times the number of processes should match ncall2*itmx2
in  test/powheg.input

then number nubounds times the number of processes should match ncall2*itmx2
in  test/powheg.input should match the value of nubound in  test/powheg.input.
