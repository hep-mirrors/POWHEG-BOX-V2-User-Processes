Parallelization via MPI can be achieved by copying the files in this folder
in the process subfolder.
Two examples are provided:

1) runparallel-mpi.f

that performs the parallel stages 1 to 4, with 2 iterations in the stage 1 (grid adaptation)

2) runparallel-mpi-PYTHIA8.f

that performs the showering in parallel.

These files can be compiled with e.g. 

mpif90 runparallel-mpi.f -o runparallel-mpi

and then run via e.g.

mpirun -n CORES runparallel-mpi pwhg_main-COMPILER

The users can easily adapt them to their needs. In case of doubts please contact the authors.
