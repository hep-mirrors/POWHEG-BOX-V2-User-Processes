There are two programs required for this powheg process: LHAPDF and LoopTools.
You need to point the Makefile to these dependencies.

In order to run powheg-directphoton, we advise you to use the example directory 'testrun-lhc'.
There is a README and a script to help you with the generation of POWHEG level events (LHEF files).
A second directory 'pythia_example' provides an example on how to apply the Pythia8 parton shower
on the LHEF files.
