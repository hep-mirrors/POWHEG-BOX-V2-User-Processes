# The new desired weights, in the Les Houches format.
# The user can choose to group them in the way he prefers, and give them
# the id's he likes.
# The program determined how to compute each weights from the description
# line. It loops through the weights id's present in the pwgevents.lhe file
# and through the labels of the nnlofiles. If a label of a weight and
# a label of the nnlofiles are both present in the description field
# of a weight mentioned here, it computes that weight by reweighting
# the corresponding weights in the lhe file with the nnlo result present
# in the nnlofiles associated with the label. For example, in the
# nnlops-mt id in the following it reweights the nn-mtinf weight present
# in the .lhe file with the nnlo result present in the
# HNNLO-LHC8-R04-APX0-11.top file.
