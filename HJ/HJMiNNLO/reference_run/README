This reference runs can be reproduced (within small errors) by running the
original radish_scale_variation (tagged as paper_results), provided:

1) one runs with a POWHEG-BOX-V@ version after revision r3668.
   Only this version the fixedgrid option works for manyseeds runs.

2) The call to random() to set brkn_azi is replaced by a call to the
   internal f90 random_number function (otherwise the random number
   sequence is altered):
      call random_number(rndazi)
      brkn_azi = 2*pi*rndazi
   instead of
      brkn_azi = 2*pi*random()

3) the
      C1_P1_matrix_PDFs%tab(:,:,iQ)     = C1_matrix .conv. P1_PDFs%tab(:,:,iQ)
   line in pdfs_tools.f90 is deleted. This line is superflous because the
   C1_P1_matrix_PDFs was already computed earlier with a different
   convolution order. If present, it affects the output with an error
   typical of the Hoppet convolution machinery.
   
4) In setlocalscales, line 374, should read
         if(flg_d3_in_sud.or.exclude_d3 .or. flg_bornonly) then
   i.e. that flag flg_bornonly is also added to exclude the d3term
   when bornonly is set. This avoids that the sample of underlying
   born configurations used to set the upper limits for the generation
   of radiation includes also d3, which is not the case in the version
   to be made public.

5) Position of computation of L should have been after call to
   reset_dynamical_parameters (within if block) in setlocalscales.f
   in radish_scale_variation.
