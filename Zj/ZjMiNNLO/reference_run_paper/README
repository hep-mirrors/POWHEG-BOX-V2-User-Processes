This reference runs can be reproduced (within small errors) by running the
original radish_scale_variation (tagged as paper_results), provided:

1) one runs with a POWHEG-BOX-V@ version after revision r3668.
   Only this version the fixedgrid option works for manyseeds runs.

2) The call to random() to set brkn_azi is replaced by a call to the
   internal f90 random_number function (otherwise the random number
   sequence is altered):
      call random_number(rndazi)
      brkn_azi = 2*pi*rndazi
   instead of
      brkn_azi = 2*pi*random()

3) the
      C1_P1_matrix_PDFs%tab(:,:,iQ)     = C1_matrix .conv. P1_PDFs%tab(:,:,iQ)
   line in pdfs_tools.f90 is deleted. This line is superflous because the
   C1_P1_matrix_PDFs was already computed earlier with a different
   convolution order. If present, it affects the output with an error
   typical of the Hoppet convolution machinery.
